I am a statistician and data scientist working on health outcomes, biomarkers, and statistical/machine learning with applications in bioinformatics. 

I am an assistant professor of Biostatistics in the [Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences](https://www.binghamton.edu/pharmacy-and-pharmaceutical-sciences/departments/pharmaceutical-sciences/index.html) at [Binghamton University School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences](https://www.binghamton.edu/pharmacy-and-pharmaceutical-sciences/). I also have a courtesy title at the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www2.math.binghamton.edu/p), where I received my PhD.

Before joining Binghamton SOPPS I was a postdoctoral associate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.bu.edu/sph/about/departments/biostatistics/) at [Boston University School of Public Health](https://www.bu.edu/sph/) under the supervision of [Dr. Kathryn Lunetta](https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/kathryn-lunetta/) and [Dr. Joanne Murabito](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/profile/joanne-murabito/). We perform analyses to investigate associations between circulating immune cells and inflammatory biomarkers with cognitive decline, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. 

I received my PhD in Mathematical Sciences with a concentration on Statistics in 2020 under the guidance of [Dr. Sanjeena Dang (Subedi)](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjeena/home?authuser=0). My PhD dissertation focused on developing various model-based clustering algorithms for non-Gaussian data.
