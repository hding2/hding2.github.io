I am a postdoctoral associate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.bu.edu/sph/about/departments/biostatistics/) at [Boston University School of Public Health](https://www.bu.edu/sph/). I am a statistician and data scientist working on health outcomes, biomarkers, and statistical/machine learning with applications in bioinformatics. 

At BU, I work with [Dr. Kathryn Lunetta](https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/kathryn-lunetta/) and [Dr. Joanne Murabito](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/profile/joanne-murabito/) on the project studying the role of peripheral immune cells in cognitive aging in the [Framingham Offspring Study](https://framinghamheartstudy.org/) (FHS). We perform analyses to investigate associations between circulating immune cell phenotypes in the pro-inflammatory and regulatory pathways with cognitive decline, dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). I also have an interest in modeling heterogeneity in cognitive function trajectories in the FHS participants.

I received my PhD in Statistics from the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www2.math.binghamton.edu/p) at [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/) in 2020 under the guidance of [Dr. Sanjeena Dang (Subedi)](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjeena/home?authuser=0). My PhD dissertation focused on developing various model-based clustering algorithm for non-Gaussian data.
