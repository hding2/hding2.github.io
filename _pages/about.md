I am a postdoctoral associate at Boston University School of Public Health Department of Biostatistics. I completed my PhD in Statistics at Binghamton University in 2020. I am a statistician and data scientist working on health outcomes, biomarkers, and statistical/machine learning with applications in bioinformatics. 

My work statistical learning is on developing novel model-based clustering clustering algorithms for complex biological datasets such as microbiome data. My collaborative and applied work mainly focuses on two health outcomes: 1) to understand phenotypic and treatment response variability in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); and 2) identify circulating immune cell phenotypes in the pro-inflammatory and regulatory pathways that are risk factors for cognitive decline, dementia and Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD).
